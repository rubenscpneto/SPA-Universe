# JavaScript HTML CSS | SPA Universe

A project that uses JS to make a Single Page Application.

In a SPA, the only thing that changes when you move between tabs in the webpage, is the HTML. It makes the Application a lot lighter and it's a great choice for more simplistic webpages that don't require as much functionalities.

In this project Clean Code was used, making it maintainable for updates and refactoring if needed.

This project also uses node_modules.
